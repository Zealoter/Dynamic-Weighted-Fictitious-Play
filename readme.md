#   Dynamic Weighted Fictitious Play

This code is the accompanying code for the paper  *From First-Order to Second-Order Rationality:Advancing Game Convergence with DynamicWeighted Fictitious Play*.
This paper has been accepted by PRICAI 2024. 

This code implements multiple algorithms such as RM/RM+/Greedy RM/FP/DWFP and supports different weight implementation forms. 
It can be used as a baseline for solving the Nash equilibrium of two-player zero-sum normal form games .
